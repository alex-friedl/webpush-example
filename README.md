# Web-Push Example

Example for client/server using web-push notifications.

The server is based on [feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/) and [node-pushnotifications](https://github.com/appfeel/node-pushnotifications).

The client code is taken from [https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/push-messaging-and-notifications](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/push-messaging-and-notifications). It is slighty shortened and adapted for our needs and will be refined in the future.

The client currently only works with Google Chrome.
